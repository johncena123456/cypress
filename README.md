improvements:
1) I can add page object structure to the project to avoide rewriting common elements
2) I can add an Abstract layer which has only cypress methods to intract with browser. To control the way methods are declared and have common template accross the project.
3) I can add an API layer to execute some of the repeated (or prequisites) test steps
